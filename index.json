I work at the intersection of Machine Learning, High-Performance Computing and Big Data. I am passionate about projects which use any combination of the three. For my PhD, I built real-time data analysis systems using GPUs which process terabytes of data every day for telescopes worldwide. I developed state of the art computer vision models to help astronomers and scientists discover hundreds of new astronomical events. These models are now deployed at three of the worlds largest telescopes sifting through tens of thousands of images every day, saving hundreds of human hours. I previously held the position of Artificial Intelligence Fellow at Insight Data Science, where I worked on generative models for cleaning document images. Outside work, I am a huge Star Trek fan and love cooking. I regularly lead remote teaching and discussion sessions with Machine Learning Tokyo to study and work on Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects on weekends. You can check out my thesis here and find a talk about it below! ","date":"2020-12-15","objectID":"/about/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"About","uri":"/about/"}]
